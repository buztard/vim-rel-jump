SUMMARY                                                            *rel-jump*

In addition to printing line numbers in a sequential way, recent Vim versions
also support showing line numbers relative to the cursor position by setting
the |'relativenumber'| option. With this option enabled, it's way more
comfortable to go to a line that's visible on the screen by typing 23k instead
of 1827G. But as a drawback using [count]j and [count]k is not a jump-motion,
so you won't be able to jump back to the previous line using <C-O>. (See
|jump-motions| for details). To fix this behavior, this plugin adds a jump
mark every time you precede a vertical motion with |j| or |k| with a [count].

OPTIONS                                                    *rel-jump-options*

In case you only want to add jump marks for larger motions than two lines, set
this variable to a number of choice.
>
    let g:rel_jump_min_distance = 5

HINTS                                                        *rel-jump-hints*

This plugin only adds jumps to motions with j and k. If you really prefer
using <Up> and <Down> instead of keeping your fingers on the home-row, you can
put this in your vimrc:
>
    nnoremap <silent> <Up> :<C-U>call RelJump('k')<CR>
    nnoremap <silent> <Down> :<C-U>call RelJump('j')<CR>
<
