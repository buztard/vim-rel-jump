rel-jump.vim
============

`rel-jump.vim` turns [count]j and [count]k motions into jumps. This way
you'll be able to jump back to the previous line by using &lt;C-o&gt;, which is
very handy in conjunction with Vim's `relativenumber` option.

See `:help rel-jump` for details.

Installation
------------

Install `rel-jump.vim` by copying the contents of `doc` and `plugin` to the
equivalent directories in your .vim directory, or use tpope's [pathogen.vim][1]
to keep your .vim directory clean.
